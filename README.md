# Qotes-Nippon-Colors [![CircleCI](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/Qotes/Qotes-Nippon-Colors/master.svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Qotes/Qotes-Nippon-Colors) [![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/Qotes/Qotes-Nippon-Colors.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

A set of colors exported from [NIPPON COLORS - 日本の伝統色](http://nipponcolors.com) to [https://qotes.github.io/Colors](https://qotes.github.io/Qotes-Nippon-Colors).

## Disclaimer

It's designed to be capable of rendering any set of colors as long as they suit [the data schema](src/colors.ts) as the whole site is built, unlike the _NIPPON COLORS_ which is mostly with pictures, with pure JS + css. So the key of it is portable, since we're not rendering with pictures, and responsive.

Another significant difference worth mentioning is that the repo is much more practicle, it's not just for displaying but a tool helps on choosing colors.
